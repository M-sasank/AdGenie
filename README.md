### **AdGenie - The "Robot Marketing Intern"**

**The Problem:**
Small to medium businesses struggle to create timely, relevant social media content. They miss out on key marketing moments because they lack the time and resources to react to real-world events like a change in weather, a new inventory drop, or a flash sale.

**Our Solution:**
An App that acts as a **"marketing intern"** for every business, big and small.

The platform automatically generates and posts hyper-relevant ads to Instagram based on real-world triggers, which can be customized by the user.

**How It Works (High-Level workflow):**

1. **Onboarding:** A business signs up via a simple web UI, defines its brand identity (voice, vision, business type), and selects its desired triggers (e.g., weather conditions, inventory levels, sales data).
2. **Triggering:** Our serverless backend (AWS Lambda) constantly monitors for these triggers.
3. **AI-Powered Generation:** When a trigger fires, a serverless function prompts generative AI models (from bedrock) to create a unique, on-brand ad and caption based on the trigger and the business's profile.
4. **Automated Posting:** The function then posts the generated content directly to the business's Instagram account via the Graph API.

**Why This Is Interesting:**

- **Truly Automated:** It removes the creative and logistical friction for business owners.
- **Hyper-Relevant:** Ads are generated in response to real-time events, making them far more effective.
- **Infinitely Scalable:** The serverless architecture ensures it's incredibly cost-effective and can handle any number of clients and triggers without manual intervention.

We're planning to add a performance dashboard and an approval workflow in V2 out of this hackathon.

Would love to get your expert take on the technical feasibility and potential of this idea.

### Next Steps (after hackathon)

1. We can hire designers to add some predefined designs that business can pick from
2. Integration with leading POS like Square and Shopify
3. Approval system for AI designed posts before uploading
